The goal is to place 8 queens on a standard 8Ã—8 chessboard such that no queen can attack any other queen. In chess, a queen can attack any piece that shares the same row, column, or diagonal.
The challenge stems from finding arrangements where all 8 queens are safe from each other, meaning:

No two queens can be in the same row
No two queens can be in the same column
No two queens can be on the same diagonal
